DescDetail: <<
Jailkit is a set of utilities to limit user accounts to specific files
using chroot() and or specific commands.  Setting up a chroot shell, a
shell limited to some specific command, or a daemon inside a chroot
jail is a lot easier and can be automated using these utilities.

Jailkit is known to be used in network security appliances from several
well known manufacturers, internet servers from several large
enterprise organizations, internet servers from internet service
providers, as well as many smaller companies and private users that
need to secure cvs, sftp, shell or daemon processes.
