DescDetail: <<
The Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) is a set of packages that provides a
framework and implementations for encryption, key generation and key
agreement, and Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms.  Support for
encryption includes symmetric, asymmetric, block, and stream ciphers.  The
software also supports secure streams and sealed objects.

JCE is integrated into the JDK as of 1.4.
