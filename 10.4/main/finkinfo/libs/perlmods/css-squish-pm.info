DescDetail: <<
This module takes a list of CSS files and concatenates them, making sure to
honor any valid @import statements included in the files.

The benefit of this is that you get to keep your CSS as individual files,
but can serve it to users in one big file, saving the overhead of possibly
dozens of HTTP requests.

Following the CSS 2.1 spec, @import statements must be the first rules in a
CSS file.  Media-specific @import statements will be honored by enclosing
the included file in an @media rule.  This has the side effect of actually
improving compatibility in Internet Explorer, which ignores media-specific
@import rules but understands @media rules.

It is possible that future versions will include methods to compact
whitespace and other parts of the CSS itself, but this functionality is
not supported at the current time.
