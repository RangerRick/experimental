DescDetail: <<
iLBC (internet Low Bitrate Codec) is a FREE speech codec suitable for
robust voice communication over IP.  The codec is designed for narrow
band speech and results in a payload bit rate of 13.33 kbit/s with an
encoding frame length of 30 ms and 15.20 kbps with an encoding length
of 20 ms.  The iLBC codec enables graceful speech quality degradation
in the case of lost frames, which occurs in connection with lost or
delayed IP packets.

Features:
 * Bitrate 13.33 kbps (399 bits, packetized in 50 bytes) for the frame
   size of 30 ms and 15.2 kbps (303 bits, packetized in 38 bytes) for
   the frame size of 20 ms
 * Basic quality higher then G.729A, high robustness to packet loss
 * Computational complexity in a range of G.729A
 * Royalty Free Codec
