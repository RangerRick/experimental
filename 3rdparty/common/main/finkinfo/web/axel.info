Description: Light download accelerator for FTP and HTTP
DescDetail: <<
	This program tries to accelerate the downloading process by using multiple
	connections for one file. Starting from version 0.97, the program can use
	different URL's for one download as well. The program tries to be as light
	as possible (25-30k in binary form), so it might be useful as a wget clone
	on byte-critical systems.
<<
DescUsage: <<
	Run the program like this:
		axel ftp://ftp.nl.example.com/some-file.tar.bz2

	...for a simple single-server-multiple-connection download, or:
		axel ftp://ftp.{nl,be,de}.example.com/some-file.tar.bz2

	...if you want to use those three servers for the download. The program can
	do an automatic search for FTP mirrors as well (filesearching.com), but
	that's not yet perfect... Just try the -S option. (The line above should at
	least work with the Bash shell. You can type all the mirrors by hand as
	well, if you really want to...)
