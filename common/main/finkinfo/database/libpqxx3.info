Description: PostgreSQL C++ interface
DescDetail: <<
Welcome to libpqxx, a C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.

There are many similar libraries for PostgreSQL and for other databases,
some of them database-independent.   Most of these, however, are fairly
C-like in their programming style, and fail to take advantage of the full
power of the C++ language as it has matured since the acceptance of the
Standard in 1996.  What libpqxx brings you is effective use of templates to
reduce the inconvenience of dealing with type conversions; of standard C++
strings to keep you from having to worry about buffer allocation and
overflow attacks; of exceptions to take the tedious and error-prone
plumbing around error handling out of your hands; of constructors and
destructors to bring resource management under control; and even basic
object-orientation to give you some extra reliability features that would
be hard to get with most other database interfaces.
