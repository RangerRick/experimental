DescDetail: <<
Duration objects are simple mechanisms that allow you to operate on
durations of time.

They allow you to know how much time has passed since a certain point in
time, or they can tell you how much time something is (when given as
seconds) in different units of time measurement.

Durations would particularly be useful for those scripts or applications
that allow you to know the uptime of themselves or perhaps provide a
countdown until a certain event.
