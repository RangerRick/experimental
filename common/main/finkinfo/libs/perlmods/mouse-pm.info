DescDetail: <<
Moose is wonderful.

Unfortunately, it's a little slow.  Though significant progress has
been made over the years, the compile time penalty is a non-starter
for some applications.

Mouse aims to alleviate this by providing a subset of Moose's
functionality, faster.  In particular, "has" in Moose is missing
only a few expert-level features.
