Description: Image Effect Library

DescDetail: <<
Blitz is an interm image effect library that people can use until KDE4.1 is
released. KImageEffect, the old image effect class is being dropped for KDE4.0
and the replacement, Quasar, won't be ready until KDE4.1. Blitz gives people 
something to use in the meantime.

At first glance Blitz may look like a KImageEffect2. That is what I originally 
intended. Nonetheless most of the effects have significantly changed so
may operate differently. Many of the methods in KImageEffect were quick hacks 
and ports I made. With Blitz I finally sat down, read my old code, and 
reimplemented everything. In some cases this was just code cleanup and 
bugfixing but in many other cases I used better algorithms and/or custom MMX 
code. Expect differences, hopefully for the better. I'm a little older,
a tad bit wiser, and a heck of a lot less drunk these days >:)
